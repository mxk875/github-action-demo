# Sure! Here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow to create a release:

name: Create Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: |
            Release notes for ${{ github.ref }}
          draft: false
          prerelease: false

      - name: Upload Release Asset
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./path/to/your/asset.zip
          asset_name: asset.zip
          asset_content_type: application/zip


# This workflow triggers when you push a tag that matches the pattern `v*.*.*`. It checks out the code, creates a release, and uploads an asset to the release.
